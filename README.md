Welcome to the Digital Developer Conference Hybrid Cloud - Integrating Healthcare Data in a Serverless World! 

The conference is over... please email pbastide@us.ibm.com with questions.

In this lab, developers integrate a healthcare data application using [IBM FHIR Server](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/) with [Red Hat OpenShift Serverless](https://cloud.redhat.com/learn/topics/serverless) to create and respond to a healthcare scenario.

This lab is a companion to the session *Integrating Healthcare Data in a Serverless World* at [Digital Developer Conference - Hybrid Cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/conferences/digital-developer-conference-hybrid-cloud/).

The content for this lab can be found at [https://ibm.biz/ibm-fhir-server-healthcare-serverless](https://ibm.biz/ibm-fhir-server-healthcare-serverless).

Have fun!
